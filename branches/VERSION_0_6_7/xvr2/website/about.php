Hi, my name is Juan V. Guerrero, I&acute;m the guy who started this
thing. I really hope that someday xvr2 will become something good
for everybody, but in the meanwhile I need to code a lot to make this
thing work, dont u think?.<br>
Even though I designed this thing is also truth that I am not alone, my
fiance, Swetkernelpanic and my friends Striker and Shishio are helping
me we this stuff.<br>
I started to work on xvr2 on june of 2002 so we can say that I have
more than a year with this library and it still is alpha, well some
people say that rushing is not good<br>
