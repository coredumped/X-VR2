 @mainpage X-VR2 Framework
 @section libs_sec Introduction
 X-VR2 is a C/C++ set of development libraries and components which can be used
 to create all kind of applications whether they are networked, multi-threaded, or
 database driven is up to you and your imagination what the limits are with the
 current set of tools provided in this current version.\n
 This framework is also the evolution of the former clawlib library 
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/clawlib which was aimed as a cross-platform
 library for multithreaded/networked and database driven applications for the
 Linux and Solaris operating environments only. Today X-VR2 has lost a lot of
 code from clawlib and is in the process of being cross-platform as its predecessor
 was.
 @section xvr2_feats Features
 @subsection core_sub Core library
 This is X-VR2's heart, it holds the code for the multi-threading facilities, 
 String class, exception handling foundation, dynamic object loading, date/time
 manipulation, file i/o, etc. You will not see here container classes like 
 vector and the other, for that please use the standard library.
