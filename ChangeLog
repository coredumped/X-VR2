* At Thread classes:
  * The Thread class now stores its scheduling policy internally.
  * The ThreadManager is now using an xvr2::Map to store Thread information
  * We've made it impossible to start a Thread by pointer, now it can only be
    started by referencing a Thread Object.
  * Finally fixed the ThreadManager::currentIsMain() method to determine if it
    is being called from the main thread (main function?).
* Now we have a base abstract Logger class
* The Log class has been renamed to FileLogger and is an implementation of
  xvr2::Logger.
* Added some operators for interaction between the Date classes and integers.
* Added a method for substracting two xvr2::Timestamp objects, such function
  returns the amount of seconds.
* Added two more example programs datentime.cpp and file_logger.cpp
* Eliminated the Unix class, for portability concerns.
* Extended the ElementNotFound exception to bring more information.
* Removed the dangerous ++ and -- operators from the SharedVar class
* The Syslog class is no longer a part of the xvr2 main namespace.

2008-07-28 Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>
* Implementing the xvr2:SQL::Driver::resetConnection() method at Connection 
  class level.

2008-07-26 Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>
* Many changes to the abstract xvr2::SQL::Driver class
  * Added support for data extraction in bulk, also implemented in the 
    PostgreSQL driver.
  * Adding a method for resetting database connections (diconnecting, then 
    reconnecting).
* PostgreSQL driver changes:
  * Adding default timeout of 30 seconds (configurable at compile time with the 
    DEFAULT_PGSQL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT macro.
  * Better error checking on connection attempts, also better exception 
    reporting in such events.
* And some other undocumented changes which I can't remember right now :-(


2007-12-27 Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>
* It is now possible to enable a stacktrace dump when the environment variable
XVR2_DEBUG_DUMPTRACE is defined

2007-12-27 Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>
* Added a class for handling URIs to the xvr2::Net namespace

2007-08-29  Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>
* Added a String example program based on earlier demos. 

2007-08-27  Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>
* Some documentation added to the String, BasicString and BackgroundFunction
class
* Renamed the demos subdirectory in the Core namespace to examples.
* Fixed old SQL example program for RDBMS connectivity.
* Replaced some important macros with constant String values, these constants
where the ones holding things like X-VR2 version string, version numbers,
compile-time installation path, etc.

2007-08-23  Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>
* An example program was made to test the SQLite driver.
* Deprecated the ResultSet::fetchNextRow method in favor of ResultSet::FetchRow
* Renamed some source files in the SQL namespace/dir 

2007-08-20  Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>
* DB namespace changed to SQL, consecuently the xvr2db library has been renamed
to xvr2sql. This was needed because that namespace was used only for SQL stuff
DB was a too generic name also.
* Adding an examples section to the now called SQL namespace.

2007-08-19  Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net>

* Build system reorganized, now we have a single configure script instead of
the complex multi-configure monster we used to.
* Mayor directory reorganization, more intuitive each library is located on
a subdirectory named as its namespace.
* A SQLite driver for database connectivity is in the works.
* Lots of useless classes got deprecated, some even eliminated.
* Support for the "experimental" (should I say crappy?) garbage collector has
been dropped.
* More information has been added to some exception classes, a review of all
of them is on the way also.
* A single Doxygen config file for documentation has been implemented.
* Added two more connect methods to the SQL driver abstract superclass, one
which enables to connection to database FIFOs and another for opening embedded
databases.
* Eliminating the potentially dangerous killMe() method from the Thread class.
