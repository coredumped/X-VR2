<span style="font-weight: bold;">xvr2</span> is or intends to be a
cross platform C++ library, why it is under the GPL? because the only
way to achieve our goals is using all the help we can get from the
community, and is also fair to give this effort back to them.<br>
There 6 target platforms we have in mind for deploying this library:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Linux</li>
  <li>SGI/IRIX</li>
  <li>*BSD</li>
  <li>MacOSX</li>
  <li>SUN/Solaris</li>
  <li>IBM/AIX</li>
  <li>HP-UX</li>
</ul>
Right now we are working only on Linux because we had no access, of course, on
our free time to any of the above environments, so please if anyone
wishes to donate a box of each of the above it will be greatly
appreciated. I had access in the past to some SUN boxes so a little
porting work has been done, probably in a few months I will have access
to some AIX boxes but for the other platforms I really have some
difficulties.<br>

Who are we anyway?</span><br>
Lets just say that we are a bunch of people who have fun coding stuff,
we love C++, we are not C++ gurus (yet). Currently there are like four
people involved in this: Sweetkernelpanic, Striker, Shishio and
Coredumped&acute;&acute;. We are all panamanians. Did I told you that
Coredumped is in love of Sweetkernelpanic?<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">How does xvr2 looks like?</span><br>
Take a close look at this <a href="manual/inherits.html">graph</a>.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Is this a whole C library wrapping?</span><br>
Well..... no, but we are going to wrap as much as possible to add just
two things, code easyness and portability.<br>

History</span><br>
Some friends and I use to work for a system integration company, this
company had an experimental software development department, someday
they told us to build somekind of scheduling daemon, but we prefer to
play and use the opportunity to experiment a little, by that time we
created a Linux/Solaris cross platform, but because of an NDA we signed
the code remained with them, xvr2 is a complete new implementation of
that library in fact is better, most structured, better planned and
much, much more reliable.<br>
