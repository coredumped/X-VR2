* Build system reorganized, now we have a single confugure script instead of
the complex multi-configure monster we used to.
* Mayor directory reorganization, more intuitive each library is located on
a subdirectory named as its namespace.
* A SQLite driver for database connectivity is in the works.
* Lots of useless classes got deprecated, some even eliminated.
* Support for the "experimental" (should I say crappy?) garbage collector has
been dropped.
* More information has benn added to some exception classes, a review of all
of them is on the way also.
* A single Doxygen config file for documentation has been implemented.
* Added two more connect methods to the SQL driver abstract superclass, one
which enables to connection to database FIFOs and another for opening embedded
databases.
