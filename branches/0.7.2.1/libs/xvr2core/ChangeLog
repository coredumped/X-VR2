VERSION 0.7.0.1

	* Lots of changes has goind on with the String class, now it is
	derived from BasicString which is derived from std::basic_string this
	will give us the flexibility of also being able to wrapper the
	std::wstring class, which is good.
	* There's also being some work with the Exceptions in fact, I've tried
	to trim down the number of source files as much as possible, so far
	I've been able to generate 2 files the CoreExceptions.h and the
	CoreExceptions.cpp, I'm not entirely sure if this has to be this way
	since now when yo include CoreExceptions.h your codesize will increase
	I think this will be changed, we'll see.

	* Timestamp class is now derived from Date instead of Time, this
	change has to be performed before, sorry for the inconvinience.

VERSION 0.7.0 
Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net> - Jan 16 2006
	* SQL Driver Interface has been updated to be more object oriented
	* The String class is now based on the BasicString class template in
	order to permit character types different than char, like w_char
	* Now every class derived from Object has a String representation
	* It is now possible to "print" any type of Object to the Console or
	to a std::ostream (like std::cout)
	* The work towards interfacing std::string and xvr2::String has begun
	* The thread interface has suffered big changes, it is not needed any
	more to define your threads as classes, you still can do it but now
	you'll also have the option to just define the threadable routine.
	* Inline exception tracing has been added trough the ExceptionTracer
	class
	* Finally I've started to work with SSL Sockets, the work is not
	finished yet.
	* X-VR2 has been succesfully compiled under AMD64, it is unknown if
	this release is still compatible with SUN Solaris.

	* Finally fixed the weirdest type casting expressions, basically (as
	allways) it was my fault for not taking the time to learn C++ as it
	should be. Some other parts of the code in the String class might
	still be broken, I'll be writing some demo programs to test which
	pieces are still broken
