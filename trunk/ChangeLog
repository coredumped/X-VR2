* DB namespace changed to SQL, consecuently the xvr2db library has been renamed
to xvr2sql. This was needed because that namespace was used only for SQL stuff
DB was a too generic name also.
* Adding an examples section to the now called SQL namespace.

* Build system reorganized, now we have a single configure script instead of
the complex multi-configure monster we used to.
* Mayor directory reorganization, more intuitive each library is located on
a subdirectory named as its namespace.
* A SQLite driver for database connectivity is in the works.
* Lots of useless classes got deprecated, some even eliminated.
* Support for the "experimental" (should I say crappy?) garbage collector has
been dropped.
* More information has been added to some exception classes, a review of all
of them is on the way also.
* A single Doxygen config file for documentation has been implemented.
* Added two more connect methods to the SQL driver abstract superclass, one
which enables to connection to database FIFOs and another for opening embedded
databases.
* Eliminating the potentially dangerous killMe() method from the Thread class.
