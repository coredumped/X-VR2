VERSION 0.7.0 
Juan V. Guerrero <mindstorm2600@users.sourceforge.net> - Jan 16 2006
	* SQL Driver Interface has been updated to be more object oriented
	* The String class is now based on the BasicString class template in
	order to permit character types different than char, like w_char
	* Now every class derived from Object has a String representation
	* It is now possible to "print" any type of Object to the Console or
	to a std::ostream (like std::cout)
	* The work towards interfacing std::string and xvr2::String has begun
	* The thread interface has suffered big changes, it is not needed any
	more to define your threads as classes, you still can do it but now
	you'll also have the option to just define the threadable routine.
	* Inline exception tracing has been added trough the ExceptionTracer
	class
	* Finally I've started to work with SSL Sockets, the work is not
	finished yet.
	* X-VR2 has been succesfully compiled under AMD64, it is unknown if
	this release is still compatible with SUN Solaris.

	* Finally fixed the weirdest type casting expressions, basically (as
	allways) it was my fault for not taking the time to learn C++ as it
	should be. Some other parts of the code in the String class might
	still be broken, I'll be writing some demo programs to test which
	pieces are still broken
